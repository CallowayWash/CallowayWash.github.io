		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>I have been creating art since I could pick up a pencil and have loved every second of it. I tend to seek out new forms of art to try or test out, always willing to learn and expand my artistic abilities. Luckily, my school district, my vocational program, and my parents have all helped to facilitate this goal. There is much I could discuss, but here are key points worth mentioning should you be interested in hiring me.</p>
